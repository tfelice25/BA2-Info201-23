## Background of the Data
In 2015, Seoul, South Korea created a new type of public transportation in the form of Bike sharing. The data used in the following interactive visualizations and analysis was provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It shows data on bike rentals over a two year period: from December 2017 to November 2018. The dataset includes 14 variables (columns) and 8,760 separate enteries (rows)."

## Goals
We want to analyze what environmental conditions inform demand rates of rentable bikes. Specifically, we imagined our audience would be the managers and designers of bike share companies (such as lime, Bird, MoBike and others), as these individuals would have a special interest in this data. We also imagined our data and our visualizations would be helpful to organizations trying to design cleaner transportation systems to help prevent climate change. At the end of our analysis, we want to be able to determine "when is the best time, and what are the best environmental conditions, to increase bike stock availability the most?"

## Findings and Conclusions
Obvious starting point is scaling up the number of available bikes during non rainy summer days, in particular June. This ensures that during those peak times there is enough bikes to meet demand. Since commute hours show surges in rentals, not only should there be more bikes available during 7am and 6pm but this information might also give insight into where bikes should be positioned. In the mornings, areas where people commonly commute from should have a heavier presence of bikes and at 6pm the city and urban areas where large amount of people work should be targeted with more bikes. Winter shows a significant drop in the number of rentals, weather and seasons are interrelated and the harsher conditions of Winter may require an alternate transportation method in order to capture the market. Not only should bike sharing companies consider this implication but other ride sharing or travel services may see an opportunity.
